fix #1
start with the admin panel, a friend of ours told me that it is a security hole that the admin and the user has the same website signing in, but it should be the same html css structure, just different file as it will be a security hole in our system, 
Super Admin Admin/Manager Cashier Customer should system should be our Roles,

fix#2
in our point of sales the stocks does not update dynamically, it is static when i make a sale the stock count doesnt change until i reload the website, 


fix#3 when user is creating an account, it should validate the email that is entered upon registering, we shall implement a code system where we send the code to improve our secutiry system, user enters email, we send the code, account created 

fix# 4 when uploading a product in inventory management system ensure that everything is filled before it willl be able to put a medicine up, also there should be logs to this no?? like what medicine is added it should be recorded?
